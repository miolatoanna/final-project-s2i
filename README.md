## Final Project Frontend for start2impact University

Hello, this is my final frontend project on start2impact using Angular. 

The purpose of the project was to calculate the footprint (ecological footprint) of an air journey from the city of departure and the city of arrival using GoClimateâ€™s aPI.
The main API calculates the ecological footprint as kg of CO2 per passenger.
